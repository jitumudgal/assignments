    "Ans 13. Some benefits of Python : a. Large developer community. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. b.Extensive libraries. Python offers a wide range of libraries that can be used across various applications.  c.Write less, do more. Python has very concise syntax. d.Portability.e. Wide range of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14.how memory is managed in python ? \n",
    "Ans 14. Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
